# Project-SkinCancerDetection
Skin Cancer Detection using Raspberry Pi and classify the type of cancer.
Built a device that captures photos, which detect and classify the type ofskin cancer in benign and malignant cases.
• Constructed a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with 80%+ accuracy.
• Classification done by using using 5MP Camera(v2) ,RaspberryPi & NCS2.
• Team project with my role being optimization and conversion of model and configuring RaspbianOS to run model using NCS2.
• Technologies Used: Raspberry Pi 4,Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandasetc.
